NEXTJS

-It is a framework, built upon React, used for Server-Side Rendering Applications

Server Side Rendering (SRR)
-Typically: Client requests the  page => Server fetches React code => 
                            => Server sende the Code to the Client => Client Renders the App
-With SRR: Client requests the (first) page => Server fetches, renders the App and send to the client

-It all about the "first render", actually. After the first rendering, everything works as it is not SSR

-It does Multipage Application, using "folders as routes"


Why use SRR?
