Webpack: Is no just a Bundler!
Bundler: Concatenate files and optimizes them
Webpack does more: 
-Loaders: Transpilation = transform files from Next Gen Features to Current Gen Features
***Next Gen features:
How it works? Webpack has Features:
-One entry point: Root javascript file. Webpack builds the dependency tree from the root file.
-Loaders: Applied in a "per level file". They apply transformations for a files (Ex: babel loader and css loader).
-Plugins: Applied to a "concatenated file". Apply a GLOBAL transformation (Ex: uglify).


Building our own Webpack config:
-Support Next Gen Javascript Features (so we need this loader)
-Handle JSX
-Css Autoprefixing
-Support image imports
-Optimize the code


Webpack config: Entrypoint=  is the file webpack will use to build the app and dependencies
